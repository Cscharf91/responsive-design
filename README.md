Responsive Web CSS Project for The Odin Project, found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-responsive-design

Website is based off of the design of The Next Web, found here: https://thenextweb.com/

This project was to practice making mobile friendly responsive web pages. I used a grid system to make the break points transition smoothly.
